# metricGraphs
This repo contains Senior Thesis metric graphs that are copyrighted by Adrian Avila and Esperanza Medina.

The metrics graphed are basic blocks, read memory instruction count, write memory instruction count, total instuction count, memory read size, and memory write size verses the number of graph vertices used in analysis. The x-axis is always the number of vertices while the y-axis varies. The four lines represent the variation in edge size that is in the range [4,8,16,32].
